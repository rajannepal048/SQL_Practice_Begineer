🗃️ SQL Practice Projects for Beginners
This project documents my hands-on SQL practice using beginner-friendly tutorials on YouTube. I recreated, experimented with, and modified multiple SQL queries to build a solid foundation in relational databases, table operations, constraints, joins, functions, and logical operators.

📌 Overview
This practice project covers essential SQL concepts using MySQL syntax. All tasks were performed using a local MySQL setup to simulate real-world data manipulation scenarios.

📁 Project Structure
sql_practice.sql: Contains all the SQL commands used in this practice.

README.md: Describes the purpose and summary of SQL operations covered.
