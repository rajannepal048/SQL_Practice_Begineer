🗃️ SQL Practice Projects for Beginners

This project documents my hands-on SQL practice using beginner-friendly tutorials online. I recreated, experimented with, and modified multiple SQL queries to build a solid foundation in relational databases, table operations, constraints, joins, functions, and logical operators.

📌 Overview

This practice project covers essential SQL concepts using MySQL syntax. All tasks were performed using a local MySQL setup to simulate real-world data manipulation scenarios.

📁 Project Structure

SQL Project.docx: Contains all the SQL commands used in this practice.
README.md: Describes the purpose and summary of SQL operations covered.

🔧 Skills Demonstrated

📂 Database and Table Management
. Creating and renaming databases and tables
. Adding, modifying, and dropping columns
. Inserting and deleting data records

🔍 Data Retrieval
. Basic SELECT, filtering with WHERE, BETWEEN, IN, and LIKE
. Ordering results with ORDER BY and limiting rows using LIMIT

✏️ Updating Data
. Using UPDATE for single and multiple column changes
. Applying conditional updates

🔑 Constraints and Integrity
. Applying PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK, and NOT NULL constraints
. Using AUTO_INCREMENT for primary keys

🔗 Joins
. INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN to combine data across tables

🧠 SQL Functions
. Aggregate functions: COUNT, MAX, MIN, AVG, SUM
. String concatenation using CONCAT

🤖 Logical Operators
. AND, OR, NOT for complex conditions

🔁 Advanced Filtering
. Wildcards (%, _)
. Combining multiple operators for nuanced queries

🧾 UNION Operation
. Merging query results from multiple tables

✅ Sample Tables Used
. employees => Stores basic employee info like name, hourly pay, hire date, and job role.
. products => Demonstrates constraints like UNIQUE, NOT NULL, and DEFAULT.
. customers and transactions => Used for practicing relational database design and foreign key constraints.
